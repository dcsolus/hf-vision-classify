1. Title Slide: Understanding Model Customization
Prompt: "A modern digital-style title slide for a deep learning presentation. The background features a futuristic blue and black theme with abstract AI circuitry and glowing neural network connections. The title in bold, white letters reads 'Understanding Model Customization' and a subtitle below says 'Explaining Weights, Bias, and Device Selection' in a clean, readable font. The slide has a sleek, tech-oriented design with no additional clutter."

2. Replacing Classifier (Vending Machine Analogy)
Prompt: "A side-by-side comparison of two vending machines. On the left, an old vending machine stocked with only drinks (cola, juice, and water). On the right, a newly modified vending machine stocked with snacks (chips, candy, and cookies). Above the machines, a text bubble explains 'Changing the classifier to match a new task'. The background is a simple, classroom-friendly setting with warm lighting."

3. Xavier Initialization (Chocolate Chip Cookie Analogy)
Prompt: "A split-image illustration showing two cookie baking scenarios. On the left, a batch of cookies with unevenly distributed chocolate chips, some cookies having too many and others almost none. On the right, a batch with evenly spread chocolate chips. A text banner explains 'Xavier Initialization helps spread weights evenly, just like evenly distributed chocolate chips in cookies'. The kitchen background is bright and warm, resembling a home or bakery setting."

4. Bias Initialization (Balance Scale Analogy)
Prompt: "A balance scale in the center with two trays. On the left, an unbalanced scale where one side is much heavier than the other, symbolizing a poorly initialized bias. On the right, a perfectly balanced scale, representing 'Bias set to zero for a neutral start'. A small diagram above compares an AI model before and after bias adjustment. The background is clean and academic, resembling a science lab."

5. Device Selection (Car vs Bicycle Analogy)
Prompt: "A race between three vehicles on a road. On the left, a person struggling to pedal a bicycle labeled 'CPU (Slow but works)'. In the middle, a hybrid electric car labeled 'Apple MPS (Efficient)'. On the right, a sports car labeled 'GPU (Fast & Powerful)', zooming ahead. Above the road, a sign reads 'Choosing the best device for AI training'. The sky is bright and clear, giving a fun, engaging feel."
