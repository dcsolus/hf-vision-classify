1️⃣ Title Slide: Understanding Model Input Validation
Prompt:
"A futuristic AI validation system scanning incoming data. A glowing blue neural network diagram in the background with a digital interface displaying 'Input Validation'. The system is checking whether data inputs match the expected format. A clean, professional presentation-style layout."

2️⃣ Why Input Validation is Important
Prompt:
"A two-panel image comparing AI models. The left panel shows an AI model crashing due to incorrect input (red error warning). The right panel shows a properly validated AI model with green checkmarks, successfully processing data. The background is a tech-style dashboard with logs and metrics."

3️⃣ How Validation Works Step-by-Step
Prompt:
"A step-by-step infographic explaining AI input validation. Four connected icons: (1) Select a sample input, (2) Convert input to a model-friendly format, (3) Run the model on input, (4) Validate input against MLflow model signature. Clean, modern design with AI and deep learning theme."

4️⃣ Model Signature & Validation
Prompt:
"An architect-style blueprint for an AI model. The blueprint defines the expected input and output format, showing structured layers of a neural network. In the background, a digital validator is comparing a test input with the blueprint, approving valid inputs with a green checkmark."

5️⃣ Code Example: Validating Input
Prompt:
"A side-by-side comparison of Python code and AI processing validation. The left side shows code snippets from MLflow validating an input. The right side visually represents the AI model successfully processing an image input, with a progress bar and a final green checkmark."

6️⃣ Debugging Input Validation Issues
Prompt:
"A frustrated data scientist in front of a computer, trying to debug an AI model input validation error. The screen shows red error messages like 'Invalid Input Shape!' and 'Mismatch Detected'. In the background, an AI assistant suggests solutions, highlighting correct input shapes and formats."
