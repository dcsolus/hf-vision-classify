1. Title Slide: Understanding MLflow
Prompt:
"A high-tech digital slide featuring a deep learning and data tracking theme. The background is a futuristic AI dashboard with glowing charts, graphs, and data connections. At the center, bold, modern text reads 'Understanding MLflow'. Below, a subtitle says 'Tracking Experiments & Managing Models'. The design is professional, sleek, and visually engaging, with a technology-driven feel."

2. What is MLflow? (AI Lab Notebook Analogy)
Prompt:
"A futuristic AI-powered digital lab notebook on a computer screen. The notebook automatically records experiment details like training progress, hyperparameters, and accuracy graphs. In the background, a scientist or engineer is analyzing machine learning results on a large monitor. Above, a caption reads ‘MLflow: Automatically Tracks Model Training’."

3. Setting Up MLflow (Experiment Tracking Dashboard)
Prompt:
"A computer screen displaying an MLflow dashboard with a list of machine learning experiments, each showing different hyperparameters, metrics, and timestamps. In the background, a researcher or data scientist is monitoring the experiment progress. A caption at the top says ‘Setting Up MLflow for Experiment Tracking’."

4. Logging Parameters (Recipe Analogy)
Prompt:
"A chef is writing down a recipe with precise ingredients and measurements in a notebook. Each ingredient represents a machine learning hyperparameter: 'Learning Rate: 2e-5', 'Batch Size: 16', 'Epochs: 5'. In the background, a completed dish represents the trained model. A caption at the top says ‘Logging Parameters: Writing Down Model Ingredients’."

5. Logging Training Metrics (Performance Scoreboard)
Prompt:
"A large digital scoreboard displaying performance metrics like ‘Accuracy: 92%’, ‘Loss: 0.02’, and ‘Epoch: 3/5’. A researcher is analyzing the results, taking notes on a tablet. The background features a machine learning training process with progress bars and AI graphs. A caption at the top reads ‘Logging Training Metrics: Keeping Track of Performance’."

6. Saving the Best Model (Gold Trophy Analogy)
Prompt:
"A podium with three AI models represented as trophies. The best-performing model is in the center, highlighted in gold, while two lower-ranked models (silver and bronze) are on the sides. A researcher is selecting the gold model for deployment. A caption at the top says ‘MLflow Saves the Best Model Automatically’."

7. Model Signature Explanation (Blueprint for AI)
Prompt:
"An architect’s blueprint, but instead of a building, it shows an AI model’s input and output formats. The diagram includes structured labeled boxes like ‘Input: Image (224x224)’, ‘Output: Class Label (Dog, Cat, Bird)’. In the background, a data scientist is presenting the blueprint to a team. A caption at the top says ‘Model Signature: Defining Input and Output for Future Use’."
