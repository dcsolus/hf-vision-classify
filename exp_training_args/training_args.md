1. Title Slide: Understanding Training Arguments
Prompt:
"A modern, high-tech digital slide featuring a deep learning theme. The background has a futuristic AI design with glowing neural network connections and abstract blue and black circuits. At the center, bold, readable text says 'Understanding Training Arguments'. Below, a subtitle reads 'Explaining Hyperparameters in Deep Learning'. The design is sleek, professional, and visually engaging."

2. Batch Size Explanation (Teaching a Group vs. One by One)
Prompt:
"A split-screen image showing two classrooms. On the left, a teacher is explaining a lesson to one student sitting alone, symbolizing a batch size of 1 (slow learning). On the right, the teacher is instructing 16 students at once, representing a batch size of 16 (faster training). The classroom has a whiteboard, and the students are engaged in learning. A caption reads 'Larger batch = Faster learning but needs more memory'."

3. Learning Rate Explanation (Turtle vs. Rabbit)
Prompt:
"A race between a rabbit and a turtle on a track. The rabbit represents a high learning rate (fast but risky), while the turtle represents a low learning rate (slow but stable). Above them, a sign says ‘Finding the Right Speed for Learning’. The background is colorful and engaging, like a fun educational poster."

4. Weight Decay Explanation (Memorization vs. Understanding)
Prompt:
"A side-by-side comparison of two students preparing for an exam. On the left, a student is cramming, surrounded by a messy desk with too many notes, looking stressed. On the right, another student is studying efficiently, reading a textbook calmly and understanding the concepts. Above, a banner reads ‘Weight Decay: Prevent Overfitting Like Avoiding Cramming’."

5. Warmup Explanation (Stretching Before Running)
Prompt:
"A track and field scene showing two runners. On the left, one runner sprints immediately but trips and falls (symbolizing no warmup). On the right, another runner stretches first, then runs smoothly (symbolizing warmup learning rate). A caption reads ‘Gradually Increase Learning Rate to Prevent Early Mistakes’."

6. Best Model Selection Explanation (Keeping Your Best Test Score)
Prompt:
"A student is looking at their report card. They have multiple test scores, but the final grade is highlighted as the highest score they achieved. In the background, other test sheets with lower scores are crossed out. A sign above reads ‘Training Keeps the Best Model, Not Just the Last One’."
